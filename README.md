# InstaBot
## About
InstaBot was created to be a human-like message sending system for personal accounts. Due to the nature of Instabot, messages may take a while to send. This is okay, and part of the "human-nauter of the system"

## Setup
To run InstaBot, first clone this repo:
`git clone https://github.com/EhlOps/InstaBot.git`

Then installt the dependencies for the project:
`pip install -r requirements. txt`

Finally, you will want to run the `main` script. You can do this by running:
`python main.py --username=YOUR_USERNAME --password=YOURPASSWORD`

This will start the script.

## Customization

You can point the script to a new file for names by adding the `--users_file=YOUR_NEW_USERS_FILE` flag.
You can do the same for the message by adding the `--message_file=YOUR_NEW_MESSAGE_FILE` flag.

Alternatively, you can edit the message.txt and usernames.txt files to obtain custom results.
